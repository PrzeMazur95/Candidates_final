1. Download source code from : https://github.com/PrzeMazur95/Candidates_app - from main branch
2. Open SQL_CODE.docx file, and create a DB named Candidate - copy and paste code inside this file to your sql console in your host. 
   (If you would like to have role as a select, with only possible options from DB, please read Additional information)
3. All connection configurations are in Dbh.php file
3. Template of this app is downloaded, on free license from : https://startbootstrap.com/template/bare. Nav top links are free to use, there are no pages connected to them. I left them for possible later needs.
4. Show page contains a table with all users which exists in db table, with two buttons on the right side. Edit redirects to Edit this specific candidate, delete button deletes this specific user from Db table.
5. Add page allows us to add candidates to Db
6. Add role page allows us to add roles to Db, which we can use in future to chose when we want to add a new candidate
